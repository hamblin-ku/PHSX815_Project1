# PHSX815 Project 1
## Monopoly Simulation
### Description:
For this project, I will simulate a game of monopoly (from the persepcive of one player). I generate random dice rolls using the methods developed in class, and will keep track of the end positions of the player after every turn, following the traditional rules of the game (including 'Chance' and 'Community Chest' cards. I compare results from simulated games to my generated distributions of games simulated with unbiased dice to determine if the dice in the experimental games are biased.

### Parameters:
The user is able to specify the numbers of sides on the dice being used. The default is 6, but any value > 0 can be used. The user can also choose to use biased dice. 

### Usage
All python scripts can be ran from the command line with the `-h` or ``--help` flags to display all the options.
