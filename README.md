## Monopoly Simulation
### Description:
#### For this project, I will simulate a game of monopoly (from the persepcive of one player). I generate random dice rolls using the methods developed in class (see random.int(N) in Random.py), and will keep track of the end positions of the player after every turn, following the traditional rules of the game (including 'Chance' and 'Community Chest' cards.
